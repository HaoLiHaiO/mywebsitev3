        <p>First of all, don't forget to toggle the light theme if you prefer. It's available in the menu.</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Front-of-the-front-end</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">I am a proficient front-of-the-front-end developer. Never heard of that term? Check out this <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/" class="links" aria-label="Article by Brad Frost">great article</a>, called front-of-the-front-end and back-of-the-front-end web development, by Brad Frost. I love working with designers and converting their designs, sketches, mockups and drawings with HTML markup, CSS and Javascript (JS) to code accessible, fully responsive and SEO-friendly websites from scratch. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">I am also obsessed with getting the highest Lighthouse scores. Of course, we have to be careful, having a perfect lighthouse score doesn't mean everything is perfect. It's even possible to get perfect Lighthouse scores with completely inacessible and non-optimized websites as Manuel Matuzovic showed in <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/" class="links" aria-label="Link to an article by Manuel Matuzovic">an article</a> in 2019.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Back-of-the-front-end</h3>


          <p>As a front end developer, I also like back-of-the-front-end development. For example, seeing everything that is possible with APIs is something that fascinates me. Being able to work with data from NASA or Microsoft is an absolutely delightful experience. Want to know what time it is on Mars, what the temperature is over there or just see a random picture related to space exploration? Easy and fun with NASA's APIs! Handling things like CRUD functionality or controlling application states are things I do. </p>

          <h3>Technologies I use for work: </h3>
          <p> 
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS (experience with SASS/SCSS)</li>
              <li>Javascript (and React)</li>
              <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>I have full stack development experience as well with: 

            <ul class="lists">
              <li>MongoDB</li>
              <li>Sqlite</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
              <li>Express.js</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          

          <h3 class="subtitle">UI/UX Design</h3>

          <p>Having a good knowledge of UI/UX principles is essential as a front-end developer, and even as a developer in general. I love original and innovative designs, things you don't see everywhere else. Adapting those designs for them to work on all devices is something that I find really fun because I love solving problems.</p>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Back-end</h3>

          <p>I also enjoy working with back end developers and creating applications that are as optimal as possible. I have experience with back end development myself. I have played around with databases using MongoDB, MySQL and Sqlite as well as the back end web application framework for Node.js, Express.js. I think it is important to understand the basics of back end development as a front end developer. However, one should not forget that trying to excel at everything is not really a feasible goal, as pointed out by Anand Safi in  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/on-spreading-yourself-too-thin-and-other-dev-career-reflections-qs4s33t3" class="links" aria-label="Article written by Anand Safi and published on Hackernoon">an article published on Hackernoon</a>.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-language icons"></i>
        <p>I'm a technical translator. I've been working as a freelance translator, editor and proofreader for over ten years. I translate from Chinese, English, French and German into French and English. I have three master's degrees, including one in linguistics.</p>

        <p><span class="quotes">“Without translation, I would be limited to the borders of my own country. The translator is my most important ally. He introduces me to the world.”
        </span> – Italo Calvino</p>

        <p>Being bilingual doesn't mean being a good translator. A translator needs to understand the technical aspects and all related linguistic concepts. Attention to details, a deep knowledge of the topic and precision are essential skills if one wants to convey a message as accurately as possible. An advanced understanding of a language and its mechanisms are what enables a translator to create nuanced and meaningful translations.</p>

        <p>Fields in which I work: 
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>Physics, mathematics and computer science</li>
            <li>Social sciences and humanities</li>
            <li>Trade and business</li>
            <li>Politics and international relations</li>
            <li>Video games</li>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <i class="fas fa-user-friends icons"></i>
        <p>I have always been interested in computer science and languages. I started coding in the 90's before CSS even existed. I grew up speaking German, French and English. I studied computer science with applied mathematics briefly and then I decided to study something else while keeping on coding at home as I had always done. I first studied international relations and linguistics and then I obtained three master's degrees. I have a master's degree in linguistics, one in German studies and one in cross-border cooperation and communication.</p>
        <p>I love learning new things and developing my existing skills and keeping up-to-date with new technologies and new scientific discoveries. In my free time, I like reading about space exploration, mathematics, computer science, quantum development and linguistics.</p>
        <p>I mainly focus on mobile-first, SEO-friendly, accessible and responsive web apps and websites but I also love experimenting in my free time and I have had the opportunity to play around with several programming and scripting languages such as C#, Python, C, C++, LISP and Haskell. We used Java and OCAML at university.</p>
        <p>I also love outdoor activities as hiking, swimming, playing golf and tennis. Let's chat! 😊</p>
